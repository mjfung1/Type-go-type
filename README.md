                2. Borders will light green if correct, and red if incorrect
        Animations
                1. Bicycle wheels around its x-axis
                2. Person moves up and down on its y-axis

        - Good animation provides visual cues to the user for better gameplay.  
        - This was achieved by using JavaScript to toggle between CSS-classes


## Future implementations 
 - SVG objects reacting to the game
 - Choosing between typing quotes or words
 - Add different time limit levels
